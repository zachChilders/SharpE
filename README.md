# SharpE
A simple and (soon to be) complete BLAS for C#

Sharpe (pronounced like the dog) hopes to fill the linear algebra void in the C# ecosystem.  
It provides easy to use Matrix and Vector classes that should support any numerical datatype without
the hassle of generics.  It also provides a convenient Complex Number class.  You can use these types
from scratch, or transform your existing data into a linear data type. 

From here on out, Sharpe is growing mathematically. I'm adding more functionality in terms of what 
operations can be carried out.  An EigenSolver, various decompositions, and many tranformations are planned.

Additionally, as much parallelism will be leveraged as is possible.  The goal is to provide a fast, responsive BLAS 
while remaining as user friendly as possible.
